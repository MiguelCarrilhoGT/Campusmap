This map was created, using a Gegraphic information system called Quantum GIS (QGIS).
The data used was processed in this system, and was collected in different sources

The entrance points were drawn in geojson.io and transfered to QGIS.

The transportation points were also created in geojson.io.
this points are not located in the transportation site, because some of them are located 
up to 763 meters away, if displayed on the map the rest of the information would 
be incomprehensible. so this points are located at the campus exit closer to the transportation site.

Other data was collected from the University's shapefiles available to students
, and some elements were excluded, like litter cans, etc. 
Only the fundamental elements were left in this map.

A base Layer was added, this layer uses google sattelite images.

Information about transportations is located to the right of the map and was collected from
each service provider's website, and field knowledge.

Links to the service provider's schedules are under the transportations information.

A small restaurant suggestion is given based on field knowledge, in case the user does not 
want to eat in campus.

The map was afterwards passed to the QGIS Composer to include scale, the North arrow, the text 
on the right, and the legend. The final map was expoorted as a PNG image and uploaded to Github.
